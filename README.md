# Mushroom checker

[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=pinjaalanne_mushroom-checker-app&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=pinjaalanne_mushroom-checker-app)

Mushroom checker is a web-based application that is used to classify and identify mushroom species uploaded by the user.

## How it works

The app was taught how to recognize several mushroom species with the help of a machine learning tool called Teachable Machine.

When a user uploads an image of a mushroom species, the app scans the database to identify the species. As soon as the app finds a mushroom species in the database that matches the user's upload, it displays that item.

Furthermore, the user can click on "View more" to see additional information related to the mushroom.
